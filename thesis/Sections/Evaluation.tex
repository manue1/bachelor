The Connectivity Manager (CM) is part of the NUBOMEDIA platform and is placed between the virtual network resource management of the cloud infrastructure and the
multimedia application. The main focus of the CM is related to management and control of network functions of the virtual network infrastructure provided by OpenStack.

Nubomedia is an elastic Platform as a Service (PaaS) cloud for interactive social multimedia. Its architecture is based on media pipelines: chains of elements providing media capabilities such as encryption, transcoding, augmented reality or video content analysis. These chains allow building arbitrarily complex media processing for applications. As a unique feature, from the point of view of the pipelines, the NUBOMEDIA cloud infrastructure behaves as a single virtual super-computer encompassing all the available resources of the underlying physical network.
